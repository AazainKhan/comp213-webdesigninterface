		Banana, fruit of the genus Musa, of the family Musaceae, one of the most 
		important fruit crops of the world. The banana is grown in the tropics, 
		and, though it is most widely consumed in those regions, it is valued 
		worldwide for its flavour, nutritional value, and availability 
		throughout the year. Cavendish, or dessert, bananas are most commonly 
		eaten fresh, though they may be fried or mashed and chilled in pies or 
		puddings. They may also be used to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads.</p>
